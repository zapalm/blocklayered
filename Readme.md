# Layered navigation block: the module for PrestaShop 1.6

## Description
The module displays a block with layered navigation filters.

Difference of this module from the original: it has the integration with `Sort products in-stock first` module.

The official repository is no longer maintained by PrestaShop developers.
If possible, I will maintain my copy of that repository if someone else needs it.

See `releases` to download the module.

You may buy `Sort products in-stock first` module on [PrestaShop Addons][1] and [ModuleZ][2].
